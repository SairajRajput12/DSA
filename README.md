# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations and explanations of various data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science and programming interviews.

## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that every programmer should understand. They form the building blocks for designing efficient and scalable software solutions. This repository aims to provide clear explanations and well-commented code implementations for a variety of data structures and algorithms.
